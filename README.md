# QR Code Generator

This is a JavaScript project that generates a QR Code as you make changes to the input fields. This project was built using HTML5, bootstrap 5 for CSS, with some lines of custom CSS, vanilla JavaScript and [qr code styling library][def]. It accepts texts and URLs as inputs with dots and corner styling for the Qr Code. Each change is displayed live as they are made. Finally, there are two download options for the generated QR Code: "Image" or "SVG" file formats.

The base code for the Qr code generating function was gotten from the repo: [oblakstudio/qr-code-styling][def2].
